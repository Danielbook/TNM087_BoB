%% Syntax of the function
%
% Input arguments:  Fimage: Image containing a face
%
% Output argument:  Mimage: Image with elliptical mask and a red eye
%
% You MUST NEVER change the first line
%
%% Basic version control (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
% Version: 1
% Date: 2015-11-17
%
% Gives a history of your submission to Lisam.
% Version and date for this function have to be updated before each
% submission to Lisam (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
%% General rules
%
% 1) Don't change the structure of the template by removing %% lines
%
% 2) Document what you are doing using comments
%
% 3) Before submitting make the code readable by using automatic indentation
%       ctrl-a / ctrl-i
%
% 4) In case a task requires that you have to submit more than one function
%       save every function in a single file and collect all of them in a
%       zip-archive and upload that to Lisam. NO RAR, NO GZ, ONLY ZIP!
%       All non-zip archives will be rejected automatically
%
% 5) Often you must do something else between the given commands in the
%       template

%% Your code starts here
%
 clear all; clc;
 FImage='einstein.jpg';
%% create the output image (RGB!) which is a copy of the original image
% Use einstein.jpg as your FImage
FImage = imread(FImage);
[sr,sc] = size(FImage);
MImage = FImage;

%% Generate the coordinates of the grid points
[C, R] = meshgrid((1:sc),(1:sr));
% Remember the matlab convention regarding rows, columns, x and y coordinates. Feel free to use
% [Y,X] = meshgrid((1:sx),(1:sy)) or whatever notation instead if you feel more comfortable with that notation



%% Pick three points that define the elliptical mask of the face
% Read more about ellipses at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse
% Your solution must at least be able to solve the problem for the case
% where the axes of the ellipse are parallel to the coordinate axes
%
fh1 = imshow(MImage);

fpts = ginput(3);
% First two is y axis, third x axis

%% Generate the elliptical mask and
% set all points in MImage outside the mask to black

x1 = fpts(1,1); %Write out the points to see things clearer
y1 = fpts(1,2);
x2 = fpts(2,1);
y2 = fpts(2,2);
x3 = fpts(3,1);
y3 = fpts(3,2);

centerPoint = [ x1, y2-y1 ]; % Assume x-axis is constant
centerDistY = sqrt( (y2-y1).^2 );
centerDistX = sqrt( (x3 - centerPoint(1,1)).^2 );

a = centerDistY/2;
b = centerDistX;

fmask = ((C-centerPoint(1,1)).^2./b^2)+((R-centerPoint(1,2)).^2./a^2)<=1;% this is the mask use C and R to generate it

MImage(~fmask) = 0;% here you modify the image using fmask

imshow(MImage);
%% Pick two points defining one eye, generate the eyemask, paint it red

epts = ginput(2);

centerPointEye = [epts(1,1),epts(1,2)];
radius = (epts(2,2)-epts(1,2))^2 + (epts(2,1)-epts(1,1))^2;

emask = ((C - centerPointEye(1,1)).^2) + ((R - centerPointEye(1,2)).^2) <= radius;% circular eye mask again, use C and R

MImage = repmat(MImage,[1 1 3]);% Convert to rgb image

MImage(emask) = 255;% replace eye points with red pixels


%% Display result if you want
